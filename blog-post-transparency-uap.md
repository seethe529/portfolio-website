# The Presentation That Never Happened: How Transparency Became a Threat

In early 2023, my work on a UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) visualization system within the Federal Aviation Administration’s System Security Operations was accepted for presentation at the ESRI User Conference. It was a project built to improve transparency—an organized, data-driven way to visualize and classify UAP reports against known satellite orbits. But that transparency was never allowed to happen.

The abstract, titled *“Comparing Reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena to Starlink Satellite Orbits,”* was accepted for presentation, marking what should have been a milestone moment in the project’s transparency and technical innovation.

## The Project and Its Shift in Direction

The original scope of the project was to develop a 3D visualization framework for increasing and analyzing UAP reports received by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATSCC). The system aimed to provide traceability, pattern recognition, and public accountability regarding UAP activity in the National Airspace System.

After the UAP visualization system was nearly complete, management introduced a new requirement to shift the project’s focus toward financial dashboarding, without clear explanation or justification for the change. During this period, I was also instructed by management to create an alias and set up a Git repository for the code related to the visualization system. No rationale was provided for the alias, and the directive contributed to concerns about the project’s direction and transparency.

## A Target for Transparency

Around that same time, I began experiencing what appeared to be coordinated psychological targeting — digital content and interactions laced with references to suicide and surveillance, seemingly designed to destabilize and manipulate my mental state. I reported these incidents through official ethics and whistleblower channels at the FAA, Leidos, and later through congressional offices, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick and Senator Robert Casey. Each step forward only led to increased retaliation and digital interference.

By the summer of 2023, my communications were being tampered with, my professional reputation undermined, and my health weaponized. When I finally resigned from Leidos, it was not a career decision—it was self-preservation.

## Documentation and Oversight

I submitted formal complaints to multiple agencies, including the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, the Air Force Inspector General, the Office of Representative Nancy Mace, and the White House. The documentation is extensive: privacy breaches, intimidation, unauthorized medical interference, and retaliation for protected disclosures. Despite clear violations of the ADA, the Privacy Act, and federal whistleblower protections, the system failed to act.

## From Disclosure to Design

The same drive for transparency that led to retaliation now fuels my current work on **orbital governance**—a framework for accountability in near-Earth space. What began as a UAP visualization system evolved into a broader pursuit: building open, traceable, and equitable systems for monitoring the orbital environment. Transparency should never be treated as a threat — it should be the foundation of trust between government, technology, and the public.
